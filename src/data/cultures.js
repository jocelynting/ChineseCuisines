      "In ancient China, the Dragon Boat Festival commemorates the life and death of the poet and statesman Qu Yuan. During the festival, people race dragon boats on rivers, eat sticky rice dumplings called zongzi, and perform various rituals to ward off evil spirits. According to legend, when Qu Yuan drowned himself in the Miluo River as an act of protest against government corruption, villagers rushed to the riverbank in their boats, beating drums and throwing rice into the water to prevent fish and evil spirits from consuming his body. To this day, the Dragon Boat Festival remains a time for reflection, celebration, and cultural heritage. The tradition of racing dragon boats symbolizes the villagers' frantic search for Qu Yuan's body and their attempts to scare away creatures lurking in the water.",

      "According to ancient Chinese folklore, the festival of Yuanxiao originated from a legend dating back over 2,000 years. In the Han Dynasty, there was a powerful minister named Zhang Liang who helped Emperor Liu Bang establish the Han Dynasty. After Zhang Liang passed away, the people missed him dearly and wanted to commemorate him. On the 15th day of the first lunar month, they prepared glutinous rice balls filled with sweet fillings like red bean paste, sesame paste, or sweetened fruit, and called them 'Yuanxiao' in honor of Zhang Liang. They believed that by eating Yuanxiao, they could express their gratitude and respect to Zhang Liang's spirit. Over time, the tradition evolved into the Lantern Festival, where people gather to enjoy the sight of beautifully decorated lanterns, solve lantern riddles, and indulge in delicious Yuanxiao with their family and friends.",
